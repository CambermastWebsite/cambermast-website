As a researcher, Loreal Jiles has interviewed large and small organizations to learn the challenges and changes affecting finance. In doing that research, she discovered momentum to progress from data stewardship to value creation through deeper collaborations. Not surprisingly -- especially given the pandemic -- there is a significant shift to finance adapting to a fast pace of change.

With this change in mind, Loreal proposes that Finance organizations consider agility to react to change, scale for efficient operations, and empower multi-disciplinary teams.

In today's podcast, Loreal shares examples of how agile can help finance teams streamline risk management, improve financial planning & analysis functions, reduce the pain and increase the efficiency of internal audits, and much more.
