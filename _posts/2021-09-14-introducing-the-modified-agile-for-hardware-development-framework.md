Are you mad at your current stage-gate hardware process? Then let Dorian Simpson and Gary Hinkle introduce you to something that will make you feel good with MAHD -- or Modified Agile for Hardware Development Framework.

Dorian and Gary will share how stage-gate, detailed process flows, and hierarchical organizational structures can slow the pace of innovation and rarely map to the reality of getting work done. Then, they will show you how to introduce an agile-first framework that puts customer value and teams first.
