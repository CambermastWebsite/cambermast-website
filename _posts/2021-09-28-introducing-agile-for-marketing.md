In our latest ""Agile for..."" series, we talk to Andrea Fryrear about Agile for Marketing. We discuss the unique structure of a marketing organization and the opportunities to reduce complexity and introduce agile methods.

We talk about the pitfalls of simply ""going agile"" with existing frameworks, how to keep the focus on strategic work (without forgetting keep-the-lights-on work), and how to reduce work efforts by at least 30%.
