We are excited to share the Agile in Action with Bill Raymond podcast is one year old! We are celebrating this by updating our website and interviewing some exciting new guests.

  
The podcast will return with weekly guests starting August 31, 2021.

  
In the meantime, we would like to ask that you take a moment to rate us 5-stars on your favorite podcast app. If you have an extra minute, then a quick review would also help. Believe it or not, that simple action helps us a lot.

  
Thank you from Bill and Reama!
